    <p>This is my favorite place throughout the trip -- The Alhambra Palace. <br>It is one of the best preserved Islamic Palaces and witnessed the prosperity of the Nastrid period. <br> Thankfully, it was protected and preserved by the monarchs even after the Catholic conquest of Granada.

    <p>If you visit Gaudi's works in Barcelona, you will notice that he was heavily influenced by the Moorish patterns of stone carving and arch design; this is especially evident in the Sagrada Familia. <br> If you plan to visit Granada in the summer, definitely try Arab baths and Iberian ham with melon!
